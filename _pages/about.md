I am a Lecturer (equivalent to an Assistant Professor) in Human-Computer Interaction at the University of Bath.

My research aims to push the boundaries of how users interact with computer interfaces by methodically researching, developing, and evaluating interactive systems which leverage novel input methods. My research includes novel interaction techniques, computer vision-based gestural interaction, eye tracking interaction, wearable technologies, and interaction in extended reality (AR/VR).

I have a broad publication record in premiere international conferences such as CHI, UIST, UbiComp/IMWUT, and TOCHI and my work has been covered by media outlets such as the [BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p05jmxj8), [New Scientist](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2148963-how-a-wave-of-your-coffee-cup-or-spoon-could-switch-tv-channels/), [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/video/2017/10/01/turn-your-head-into-a-remote-control?videoId=372645824), [the Telegraph](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/10/02/end-tv-remote-could-nigh-scientists-invent-technology-change/), and [Wired](http://www.wired.co.uk/article/control-tv-with-mug).

Previously, I was an EPSRC Doctoral Prize Researcher working in the [Interactive Systems](http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/scc/research/interactive-systems/) group at Lancaster University. My PhD investigated motion-coupling techniques using computer vision to enable interaction with any body part or object under the supervision of [Prof. Hans Gellersen](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/scc/about-us/people/hans-gellersen). During my PhD I undertook an internship at [FXPAL](https://www.fxpal.com/) in Palo Alto, California with [Don Kimber](https://worldviews.org/donkimber.html) and [Patrick Chiu](https://sites.google.com/site/patrickchiuresearch/home).
